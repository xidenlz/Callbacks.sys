## Callbacks.sys

### Brief 
Some drivers hook API functions to avoid detection, like this lovely one `eaanticheat.sys`, I’ve used this driver for a while to detect any that hook system functions and then dump them for later analysis. I didn’t originally plan to create a README, but I need to provide some sort of introduction, so here it is.
### Build 
VS 2019 / WDK 1903 

### Usage 
Remember to sign the driver before using it!
